# Data sharing

In the Brain and Development Research Center, we aim to make as much of our data accessible as possible (at least Findable and Accessible, although we also aim for Interoperable and Reusable). However, this is not always possible, for example because of privacy concerns or lacking infrastructure.

## Why share data?
- It enables others to reproduce your results and can prevent fraud and honest mistakes in data analysis
- It enables reuse of your data in work by other researchers, increasing the impact of your work

## When can I share my data?
### The GDPR  / AVG
Since May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming) has been in place in order to better protect personal data. The most important aspects of the GDPR are:
-	*Privacy by Design*: build privacy-increasing measures into your study design
-	*Privacy by Default*: make sure your default settings already improve your participants' privacy
-	*Data minimization*: Only collect and use personal data necessary for your research goal (data minimization)
-	*Lawful ground*: Make sure there is a lawful ground (6 possible) to process (and share) the personal data you collect (e.g., informed consent or public interest [**PUT LINK LAWFUL GROUNDS HERE**]())
-	*DPIA*: Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment whenever you collect (highly) sensitive data, such as names, addresses, race or health data.
-	Inform participants about the goal of the personal data collection and which data you collect.

### What is personal data?
Data is personal when you can identify someone by it, either directly (e.g., name, address) *or* indirectly (e.g., height, job, income, education). Indirect indicators are personal data if they can identify someone by their association or when *combining* such indicators so that they can only be applicable to one person. Such indicators may not only come from *your* data, but may also be publicly available! By law, data is considered identifiable when identification can occur with reasonable (proportionate) effort. Thus, it is **not** about the *hypothetical* possibility that data can be linked or combined.  Because not everyone has access to the same data, the definition of "identifiable" may differ per situation!

### Special types of personal data
- **Pseudonymous data**: Data that is only identifiable with a key (that still exists). This is the case when after encryption, it is still possible to identify someone, e.g., because the key or the source data still exist. Pseudonymous data are still considered **personal data** (but more protected than the "raw" personal data), because the encryption is **reversible**. So in order to process pseudonymous (and other personal) data, you need to base yourself on a lawful ground (most likely informed consent) and show your participants how and for what purpose their data are processed.
- **Special personal data**: Difficult to anonymize personal data that directly refer to a person, e.g., DNA, a picture, health data, biometric data. Protecting these data requires additional measures.
- **Anonymous data**: Data that are not identifiable anymore: reidentification is not possible anymore (e.g., because the key and/or source data don't exist anymore) ánd combining the data with other databases cannot lead to identification. Anonymous data are  **not considered personal data**, so processing and sharing this kind of data do not need a lawful ground.

## Anonymizing data
#### General tips
- Remove identifiers (name, address)
- Replace identifiers (e.g., date of birth by age or age groups)
- Use pseudonyms (e.g., participant numbers)
- Randomize the pseudonyms (participant numbers)
- Use only the middle range of the data: extreme cases may lead to identification because by definition, there are only few of them
- Remove the name-participant number key
- Plan how to anonymize the data up front and keep a log of your procedures
- Store original data in a safe location
- Determine whether different measures combined could lead to identification. If needed, consult a privacy officer

#### Deidentifying MRI-data
There is some debate as to whether or not MRI data can be anonymized. One paper, for example, found that brain morphology, although preprocessed, was personally identifiable [Takao, Hayashi, & Ohtomo, 2015 **INSERT DOI**](). Moreover, it could be argued that, when combining multiple databases, the data may be identifiable in that way as well. De-identifying MRI-data is therefore of high importance to preserve your participants’ privacy.
-	Anonymize the filenames: replace names with codes
-	[Remove the header information](https://loni.usc.edu/research/software?name=DiD ) (when using hdr and img files, not for nifti files)
- Deface the MRI-scans if your software does not do that automatically already
 - https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface
 - https://na-mic.org/wiki/Mbirn:_Defacer_for_structural_MRI
 - https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mri_deface/
 - https://pypi.org/project/pydeface/  

If you are uncertain whether your data are anonymous, please don't hesitate to contact a privacy officer.

## Where to share data?
Publishing data can go roughly in the following ways:

##### 1. Supplementary materials to a published paper
This is an often used method now, but is **not very findable or accessible**, especially if the paper is not published open access. Moreover, the data will not get its own persistent identifier and thus will not be [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Finally, there is often a limit to the size or number of supplementary files that a journal can host, limiting the possibilities to publish data.

##### 2.	Publishing in data repositories
For example:
-	[DANS DataverseNL](https://dataverse.nl/) (Dutch)
 - For all data and materials accompanying a publication
 - Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets (max zip file size 10 GB)
- [DANS EASY](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/home) (Dutch)
 - For data and materials, not necessarily accompanying a publication
 - Has deals with the university but still some limitations to the size of the data (max. 100 GB)
 - Is aimed more at archiving than sharing data
- [Neurovault](https://neurovault.org/)
 - For group-MRI data (such as t-maps) accompanying a publication
 - Enables meta-analysis of fMRI-studies
 - We aim to **always** upload our contrasts here. Please find instructions on how to do so **here INSERT NEUROVAULT INSTRUCTIONS DOC**
- [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)
  - max. 5 GB per file
  - Keep your data close to all other relevant files in your OSF project
  - OSF is more aimed at project management than dissemination, so it may not be ideal
- Other general-purpose repositories, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (free up to 50GB), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) (not free) or [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) (free, max 20GB private space and 5GB per file)

In all cases, make your data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and make sure the repository that you use has a long-term plan for saving the data.
See for an overview of data repositories https://www.re3data.org/

#### 3.	Publishing a datapaper
You can also publish a dataset in a data journal without the need to add it to a publication. In a datapaper, you describe the data and the methods of collecting them, without the need to analyze them. This way you will get a publication out of your data irrespective of whether or not you publish results, increasing the impact of your research. However, it often requires that you make all described data public, because the aim of such publications is to provide access to high quality datasets and to facilitate reuse. Also, most journals have some policy in which repository you should deposit the data accompanying the datapaper. Note that a datapaper will be peer-reviewed just as well as a regular article.

#### 4. Sharing case-by-case
For data that cannot be shared publicly, you can sometimes still share the data case-by-case. This can be the case:
- For MRI-data for which you have informed consent from the participants to share. You may not want to publish this publicly because of the sensitive nature of the data, but you can still share the data because you have consent. Of course this also goes for other kinds of sensitive data for which you have consent.
- For data that does not belong to a publication, data that is too large to share in another way or some other reason

###### What you can do
- Use a data sharing agreement between you and the user of the data to make sure they will not try to identify your participants or do something else you don't want with the data
- Send data safely via SURF filetransfer, share it in SURFdrive or use another form of encryption before you send data files



### Sharing data under the GDPR
Anonymous data can be shared without restriction if they are **really** anonymous (if necessary, contact a privacy officer!). You may share non-anonymous data only when:
- You have attained explicit informed consent from the participant (most used lawful ground). For special personal data, this consent should be *very explicit* ("I agree to share x, y and z"): there cannot be any doubt about this. ***Insert link here to IC template***()
- You reduce the amount of personal data shared to a minimum (data minimization principle)
- You take the necessary measures to protect your participants' privacy
- When sharing data with researchers outside of the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland (no GDPR present), make sure that country has an [adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en). If the country does not have one, you need to take extra protection measures, such as standard contractual clauses or agreements.
- In case your data are not anonymous, but you have attained consent and still want to protect your participants' privacy better, you may always use a **data sharing agreement**. This document contains what users can and cannot do with your data, for how long and if you will get credit if the user publishes about your data. ***A good example is the agreement used by [the Donders repository](LINK). The Open Brain Consent team is also working on a template agreement.***
- Write a Data Management Plan (DMP) and a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
  - A DMP contains which data you will collect, where you will save them, whether and with whom you will share them, etc.
  - A DPIA assesses the privacy risks in your project: which sensitive data will you collect and how will you protect them?
