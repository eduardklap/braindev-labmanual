# Readme lab manual
This is the lab manual of the Brain and Development Lab.

In this lab manual, you will find information about:
- Our vision on open science 
- Practices we use to implement open science in our lab
- Our vision on science communication, etc.

In this github repo, we will develop all the contents of the lab manual. When this is done, we will combine all elements into a bookdown, which can be edited by members of our team at all times so it will stay up to date.
