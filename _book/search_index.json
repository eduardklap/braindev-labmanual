Hello Readers This is a first start of a lab manual for the Brain and Development Research Center (website). The aim is to gather a lot of information how we work or how we want to work in one place in a searchable format. The easiest way is to open the html version of this document in a browser (note: this could be online but we can keep it local if preferred). Currently, a lot of useful information about setting up projects, data management, etc is scattered around the J-disk in Leiden. We aim to bring all this information together in this lab manual and while using it add other things that might be useful and important. We use R Bookdown (website), an extension of R Markdown, to make this manual. It is a great tool: we can write text, include code chunks and figures.
