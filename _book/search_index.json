Below, you can find background information and information for each route to open access publishing. 3.1 Background 3.1.1 What is open access publishing? Open access publishing means that everyone has access to your manuscripts, no matter where they are in the world and no matter if they have a journal subscription. 3.1.2 Why should I publish open access? Scientific work is often financed by public funds (tax payers) and therefore should be accessible to the general public Scientific results get more visible and their use is increased. This can eventually lead to a greater number of citations and thus more impact Some financers reward researchers that practice open science and sometimes require articles to be published open access (e.g., NWO, Horizon2020 and ERC) 3.1.3 Policies On a European level, Plan S aims to make all research openly available (not only articles, but also books and other scientific output). See the Plan S principles here. In the Netherlands, the National Plan Open Science (NPOS) also aims for 100% open access. In 2018, they planned to use institutional repositories for the green route to open access and to create more support and more openness in the costs of open access publishing. The association of universities in the Netherlands (VSNU) also plays an important role in the transition towards open access. They are responsible for negotiating with publishers, starting collaborations, communicating about open access and monitoring open access publications. Leiden University stimulates open access and has appointed an information point open access. 3.1.4 Routes to open access Publishing open access is possible via in 2 ways: 1. Golden route: via open access or hybrid journals. Our policy is to publish our publications open access via this route where possible. 2. Green route: self-archiving via an open access repository. Our policy is to always make our publications open access via this route. These ways are not mutually exclusive at all and are explained below 3.2 Golden route: open access with a journal The gold route to open access means that you publish your publication in open access directly via a journal, making the contents of your publication accessible without any obstacles. Often, the author or institution pays an Article Processing Charge (APC) in order to make the article freely accessible immediately. In the Netherlands, large deals can often make sure that you don’t have to pay this APC yourself! Publishing via the golden route can either go via an open access journal or in a hybrid journal. A hybrid journal still uses the traditional subscription model, but has added an open access option for which you need to pay extra. Since 2015, the NWO does not grant reimbursements anymore for publications in such hybrid journals. According to Plan S, the open access journals have to fulfill several requirements that you can find here. 3.2.1 Checking the quality of an (open access) journal How do you know whether or not you found a trustworthy (open access) journal for your publication? Please pay attention to the following requirements: The journal has an ISSN (International Standard Serial Number). The publisher is a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publisher Association and the journal is included in the DOAJ. The journal is connected to or is sponsored by a scientific institute or society. All articles have a DOI The journal is not part of this list of dubious publishers The content area of the journal is clearly described and the articles are in accordance with this description. The primary target group of the journal consists of researchers and scientific teachers and is mentioned on the website. The editorial board consists of renowned/well-known researchers from the discipline. The costs of publishing open access are clearly mentioned. The user licenses are clearly mentioned in each article You can also check the scoring of the journal here 3.3 Green route: publishing in a repository Publishing via the green route (“self-archiving”) entails making your publication available at a repository besides publishing it via a traditional journal. Repositories are freely accessible data storages of scientific articles and theses. Each repository should be registered in the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR). The repository of Leiden University is the Leiden Repository. N.B.: Even if you published your publication in an open access journal (golden route) and/or if your publication is available in a repository from another institution, Leiden University would like you to publish your publication in the Leiden repository as well, as long as there is at least one author affiliated to Leiden University. 3.3.1 Do publishers allow this? That depends on the version of your publication. A preprint, i.e., the version that you send to the journal before peer review, is almost always allowed (the repository will act as a preprint server). Sometimes, journals require an embargo period. Pay attention that you are not always allowed to publish the publisher’s version, i.e., the final version with your publisher’s layout and typeset (“Version of Record”). In many cases, you are only allowed to publish the postprint version, i.e., the final version (after peer review) without your publisher’s layout and typeset. You can check the journal policies in Sherpa/Romeo. Note: For articles published via the golden route, the publisher’s version may always be posted in a repository. 3.3.2 Preprints Preprints are pieces of research (often a manuscript) that have not yet been peer reviewed and published. Publishing preprints is can be considered part of the green route to open access, because it is a form of self-archiving. As preprints are open access and are considered part of the scientific record (they receive a persistent identifier), be sure to prepare your submission well, to protect your own reputation in the scientific community. See also “How should I prepare for submission?”. Please be aware that preprints could in theory be flawed because they are not peer reviewed. Therefore, after publication of the preprint, make sure you submit your work in a peer reviewed journal. 3.3.2.1 Why publish preprints? Speed: By publishing preprints, you accelerate access to scientific discoveries to other researchers, funders and society. Preprints are publicly readable and do not take long to publish (besides some checks on scientific content and ethical compliance). This means your impact is immediate! Greater reach/visibility: because preprints are open access and many preprint servers are indexed by search engines (e.g., Google Scholar), the odds of reaching more people with your work increase. Some servers, such as bioRxiv, even tweet about all of their preprints, reaching many people at the same time, who may not even be in your discipline. This may especially be important if you have null results that are difficult to publish. Feedback: Another reason may be to get more input on your work: it is not the final version and is therefore already subject to change, so why not take advantage of that? Prevent scooping: preprints are timestamped, so by posting it, you have established precedence! Individual benefits: such as showing your productivity to the world, showing that you are open to feedback (i.e. open attitude), staking intellectual claims to the methods, results and ideas, etc. 3.3.2.2 Where to publish preprints? For example in OSF Preprints (not field specific, allows sharing supplementary files), or directly via BioRxiv, PsyArXiv or SocArXiv. You can even add a preprint on ResearchGate! Choose whichever fits your topic and community best. A list of preprint servers hosted via OSF Preprints can be found here. 3.3.2.3 Feedback and updating There are different ways researchers can give feedback on preprints: - In OSF preprints, you can use their tool Hypothes.is to annotate preprints, see their help guide - You can share contact information and send feedback to each other - Some servers offer comment functionalities (e.g., when logged in) - Use (academic) twitter What you do with feedback is completely up to you. My advice: focus on comments that you feel really do improve your work. You don’t have to reply to all comments of course, or perhaps even none at all! If you want, you can update your preprint to a new version. However, note that all versions are timestamped and retained. Often new versions get a new identifier (DOI) and old versions cannot be removed! If your work gets published by a publisher, many preprint servers also offer the possibility to refer to the identifier (DOI) of your published work, so that readers of the preprint get a notification that they are not reading the most up-to-date version. 3.3.2.4 Do I always have to publish a preprint? Of course not: you determine when to publish a preprint. Reasons for publishing a preprint can be: - The journal in which you want to publish has too few open access options but you still want everyone to be able to read your findings - You want your work to be part of the scientific community fast - You are looking for more feedback on your work than just the feedback provided by peer review - You want to show how open science minded you are 3.3.3 Help with the green route At the department of Developmental and Educational psychology Leiden, all publications are fed into the Leiden Repository by Esther van den Bos. Contact her if you have any questions. Both Leiden University and Erasmus University Rotterdam have an open access team that you can contact for all kinds of questions related to open access publishing (e.g., policies, costs, practical, etc.). In 2019, the pilot “You share, we take care” was successfully conducted which applies the Taverne amendment of the Dutch copyright law in order to publish all works open access after 6 months of the original publication date. Because of this success, the plan will be more broadly implemented. 3.4 Choosing a license for your publication Often times the journal requires you to choose from several creative commons licenses for your publication. The meaning of these licenses can be found here. For all publications, aim for a license as open as possible, e.g., CC BY 4.0, CC BY-SA 4.0 or CC0. You can also use Choose a license or the Creative Commons website.
