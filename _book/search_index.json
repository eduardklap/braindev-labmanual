["data-sharing.html", "4 Data sharing 4.1 Sharing data", " 4 Data sharing In the Brain and Development Research Center, we aim to make as much of our data accessible as possible (at least Findable and Accessible, although we also aim for Interoperable and Reusable). However, this is not always possible, for example because of privacy concerns or lacking infrastructure. In this chapter, we will discuss: - How you can publish data - On which conditions you can share your data - Some de-identifying and anonymization tools - Alternatives to data sharing - Choosing a license for your data 4.1 Sharing data Publishing data can go roughly in the following ways: 4.1.0.0.1 1. Supplementary materials to a published paper This is an often used method now, but is not very findable or accessible, especially if the paper is not published open access. Moreover, the data will not get its own persistent identifier and thus will not be FAIR. Finally, there is often a limit to the size or number of supplementary files that a journal can host, limiting the possibilities to publish data. 4.1.0.0.2 2. Publishing in data repositories For example: - DANS DataverseNL (Dutch) - For all data and materials accompanying a publication - Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets - DANS EASY (Dutch) - For data and materials, not necessarily accompanying a publication - Has deals with the university but still some limitations to the size of the data - Is aimed more at archiving than sharing data - Neurovault - For group-MRI data (such as t-maps) accompanying a publication - Enables meta-analysis of fMRI-studies - Open Science Framework - max. 5 GB per file - Keep your data close to all other relevant files in your OSF project - OSF is more aimed at project management than dissemination, so it may not be ideal - Other general-purpose repositories, such as Zenodo (free up to 50GB), Dryad (not free) or Figshare (free, max 20GB private space and 5GB per file) See for an overview of data repositories https://www.re3data.org/ 4.1.0.1 3. Publishing a datapaper You can also publish a dataset in a data journal without the need to add it to a publication. In a datapaper, you describe the data and the methods of collecting them, without the need to analyze them. This way you will get a publication out of your data irrespective of whether or not you publish results, increasing the impact of your research. However, it often requires that you make all described data public, because the aim of such publications is to provide access to high quality datasets and to facilitate reuse. Also, most journals have some policy in which repository you should deposit the data accompanying the datapaper. Note that a datapaper will be peer-reviewed just as well as a regular article. ````r code xfun::embed_file(’_bookdown_files/_main_files/data-journals.Rmd’) xfun::embed_file(‘data-journals.Rmd’) "]
